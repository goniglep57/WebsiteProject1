        <p>Welcome to Skunks Shed, a family run pub in the northern-most area of Donegal. Whether for family or a stag, boom tunes or jazz, come on up and see us for the yarns. There is much to do and see, even the surrounding area of Skunks Shed is packed with things to see and do. It is great for tourists who would like to come and party, whilst also sight seeing and surfing during the day, to locals who just want a casual creamy pint.
            
            
            </p>
        <p>We offer many things in the shed-Staff parties,Stag do's, weddings, Birthday Parties, Raves, Civil Ceremonys etc. There is a rare thing that we cannot do.</p>
